<p>The Good Dinosaur delivers thrillingly beautiful animation in service of a worthy story that, even if it doesn't quite live up to the lofty standards set by Pixar,

<p>Disney's animated pacific adventure is a feast for all senses. 
    The visuals are stunningly beautiful, the songs catchy, 
    the characters lovable. All this plays together so well, 
    you don't even notice that the story is mostly put together of the
     usual chosen one tropes. Still, the film's beating heart is
      so huge that it easily sways you to have a wonderful time, 
      no matter your age.
